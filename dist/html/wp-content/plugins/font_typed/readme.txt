Add font writting animation to your WordPress posts, pages, custom post types and even sidebars using shortcodes

== Description ==

Font animation for posts allows you to add your own font animation to posts, pages, custom post types (posts) and even sidebars without the need for custom templates

The plugin enables a shortcode and options page so you can manage your animation and then output it in your post using shortcodes

Multiple code snippets can be used on a post, and multiple posts can use the same code snippet, allowing you to re-use code.
